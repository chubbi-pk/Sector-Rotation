## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: It's completely FREE! GitHub provides free hosting for public repositories.

**Q: Can I use my own domain name (like www.mysectortracker.com)?**  
A: Yes! GitHub Pages supports custom domains. You'll need to buy a domain name first, then follow GitHub's instructions to connect it.

**Q: How do I delete the dashboard?**  
A: Go to your repository Settings → scroll to the bottom → click "Delete this repository"

**Q: The website isn't working - what do I do?**  
A: Make sure:
- All 4 files are uploaded
- The files are named exactly: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`
- GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings → Pages
- You've waited 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages

**Q: Can I make the repository private?**  
A: Not if you want free hosting. GitHub Pages requires public repositories for free accounts. If you upgrade to GitHub Pro ($4/month), you can make it private.
